//Flexbox is a one-dimensional layout method for laying out items in rows or columns.

//Flex items can be re-ordered via css without messing with markup
//using the property
order: number(the position of the item);

//To create a flex container off an element

display: flex; // all direct child elements are "flex-items"

// by default it aligns in horizontal row. However we can also align it in vertical column too

// cross axis is the y-axis of flex
// main axis is the x-axis of flex

//Align along the main axis 
justify-content: value;

//Align items along the cross axis
align-items: value;

//Align when extra space in cross axis that is when there is extra space
align-content: value;

// To put the flex items in a column

flex-direction: column;

//To set specific width's to the flex items
flex-basis: value;

//To divide the flex items in a row or column in the desired ratio's 
flex: 1; //divides equally
flex 1 2 1; //divides 25% 50% 25%

//If there are too many flex items in a row or column

flex-wrap: wrap; // it will only display 12 flex items and after that it'll display in new line


//Short hand notation of flex-direction and flex-wrap
flex-flow: row wrap;


// To align items to the left,right,center in a row use 
justify-content: flex-start/flex-end/center;

//To align items vertically you must set a height first
align-items: stretch(default value);
align-items: flex-start/flex-end/center; // aligns at the beginning or ending or center of the column of the container

//We can align items themsevles rather than using the conatiner to align them.

//example:
align-self: flex-end;
